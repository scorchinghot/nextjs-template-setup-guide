# Next.js Template Setup Guide

Welcome! This repository contains a setup guide for **Next.js templates** designed to help you get up and running quickly.

**Note:**  
I originally created this guide with the intention of selling web templates, but I never ended up going down that route. So, Iâ€™m open-sourcing this guide in the hopes that it might be helpful for others who are looking to set up a **Next.js** template. 

While this guide is tailored for my specific template, the steps and tips are pretty general and can be applied to any Next.js project. So, even if youâ€™re not using this exact template, youâ€™ll still find the info useful.

If youâ€™re looking for a full template to deploy, you can find plenty on popular sites like ThemeForest. Or, you could grab one from meâ€”just sayin' ðŸ˜…. Alright, Iâ€™ll stop the shameless self-promo now.

##  How to Use This Guide

1. **Download or clone** this repo.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the step-by-step setup instructions for the Next.js template.
3. Follow the instructions in the HTML file to get your site up and running.

### What You Will Find in This Guide

- **Getting Started:** Prerequisites, Node.js setup, and instructions for starting the dev server.
- **Customization:** Learn how to customize the template with React components and Tailwind CSS.
- **Deployment:** Instructions for static site deployment and SSR deployment with Vercel.

Feel free to modify or extend this guide if youâ€™re adding more features or making changes to the template.
